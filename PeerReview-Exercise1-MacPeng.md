# Code Review for Programming Exercise 1 #
## Description ##

For this assignment, you will be giving feedback on the completeness of assignment three: Pikmini. In order to to do so, we will be giving you a rubric to give feedback on. For the feedback, please give positive criticism and suggestions on how to fix segments of code.

You only need to review code modified or created by the student you are reviewing. You do not have to review the code and project files that were given out by the instructor.

Abusive or hateful language or comments will not be tolerated and will result in a grade penalty or be considered a breach of the UC Davis Code of Academic Conduct.

If there are any questions at any point, please email the TA.

## Due Date and Submission Information ##
This code review is due on:
Wednesday, April 21st by 11:59 PM

A successful submission should consist of a copy of this markdown document template that is modified with your peer-review. The file name should be the same as it is in the template: PeerReview-Exercise1.md. You also need to include your name and email address in the Peer-reviewer Information section below. This review document should be placed into the base folder of the repo you are reviewing in the master branch. This branch should be on the origin of the repository you are reviewing.

If you are in the rare situation where there are two peer-reviewers on a single repository, append your UC Davis user name before the extension of your review file. An example: PeerReview-Exercise1-username.md. Both reviewers should submit their reviews in the master branch.

## Solution Assessment ##

### Description ###

For assessing the solution, you will be choosing ONE choice from: unsatisfactory, satisfactory, good, great, or perfect. Place an x character inside of the square braces next to the appropriate label.

#### Great ####
    Minor flaws in one or two objectives. 

#### Good #####
    Major flaw and some minor flaws.

#### Satisfactory ####
    Couple of major flaws. Heading towards solution, however did not fully realize solution.

#### Unsatisfactory ####
    Partial work, not really converging to a solution. Pervasive Major flaws. Objective largely unmet.


### Stage 1 ###

- [x] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

#### Justification ##### 
Write Justification here.
Stage 1 was perfectly implemented to move character right.
### Stage 2 ###

- [ ] Perfect
- [x] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

#### Justification ##### 
Write Justification here.
In the fastWorkerPirateCommand.cs file, the pirate should produce 1 item each two seconds instead of one.(In line 14)
### Stage 3 ###

- [x] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

#### Justifaction #####

### Stage 4 ###

- [x] Perfect
- [ ] Great
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Unsatisfactory

#### Justifaction ##### 
Write justifaction here.
This stage is great because the programmer made this jump command really fun and well implemented.
## Code Style ##

### Description ###
Check the scripts to see if the student code adheres to the dotnet style guide.

If there are sections that don't adhere to the style guide, please peramlink the line of code from Github and justify why the line of code has infractured the style guide.

It should look something like this:

* [description of infraction](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L) - this is the justification.

Here is an example of the permalink drop down on Github.

![Permalink option](../images/permalink_example.png)

Here is another example as well.

* [I go to Github and look at the ICommand script in the ECS189L repo!](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/blob/1618376092e85ffd63d3af9d9dcc1f2078df2170/Projects/CommandPatternExample/Assets/Scripts/ICommand.cs#L5)

### Code Style Review ###
The programmer actually follows the correct style we should have which is great.
#### Style Guide Infractions ####
From my point of view, everything about style is good.
#### Style Guide Exemplars ####
The programmer follows the correct coding style and also provides comments which makes the reviewers understand what does the code do.
## Best Practices ##
The best attempt in this exercise is the idea of making an enemy to push the captain to jump or the captain will lose points. I think this is more likely a
real world game.
### Description ###

If the student has followed best practices (Unity coding conventions from the StyleGuides document) then feel free to point at these segments of code as examplars. 

If the student has breached the best practices and has done something that should be noted, please add the infracture.

This should be similar to the Code Style justification.

* [description of infraction](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L) - this is the justification.

### Best Practices Review ###

#### Best Practices Infractions ####
There is only one tiny error that in the fast worker script. However, it's only a wrong float value and does not impact the usability of the code.
#### Best Practices Exemplars ####
I really like how stage 4 was implemented. The programmer made the captain character jump to avoid losing score by colliding with the enemy. This idea is more interesting
compare to only make it jump. So in my opinion, this work is terrific.
